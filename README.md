The code is currently undocumented, and is certainly **not idiomatic Go**. Pull requests are welcome!

Sample code can be found in [`dict_test.go`](https://github.com/dyatlov/gostardict/tree/master/dict_test.go).

Project Overview
---
The project was started as an attempt to read stardict dictionaries in language learning webservice and grew into a tool supporting several dictionary formats.

Current limitations:

  * Whole dictionary and index are fully loaded into memory for fast random access
  * DictZip format is not supported, it is processed as a simple GZip format (means that no random blocks access is supported as in DictZip)
  * Syn files are not processed
  * There's no recovering from errors (means that dictionaries should be well formed)

Not tested but should be working in theory (I didn't find dictionaries with those properties in place):

  * 64bit offsets
  * multi typed dictionary fields


Dictionary Functions
---
`func NewDictionary(path string, name string) (*Dictionary, error)` - returns `gostardict.Dictionary` struct. `path` - path to dictionary files, `name` - name of dictionary to parse

`func (d Dictionary) GetBookName() string` - returns dictionary' book name (from ifo file)

`func (d Dictionary) GetWordCount() uint64` - returns dictionary' word count (from ifo file)
